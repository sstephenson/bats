.SH "NAME"
\fBbats\fR \- Bash Automated Testing System
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
bats [\-c] [\-p | \-t] \fItest\fR [\fItest\fR \.\.\.]
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Bats is a TAP\-compliant testing framework for Bash\. It provides a simple way to verify that the UNIX programs you write behave as expected\.
.
.P
Bats is most useful when testing software written in Bash, but you can use it to test any UNIX program\.
.
.SH "FILES"
To run your tests, invoke the \fBbats\fR interpreter with a path to a test file\. The file\'s test cases are run sequentially and in isolation\. If all the test cases pass, \fBbats\fR exits with a \fB0\fR status code\. If there are any failures, \fBbats\fR exits with a \fB1\fR status code\.
.
.P
You can invoke the \fBbats\fR interpreter with multiple test file arguments, or with a path to a directory containing multiple \fB\.bats\fR files\. Bats will run each test file individually and aggregate the results\. If any test case fails, \fBbats\fR exits with a \fB1\fR status code\.

If Bats is not connected to a terminal—in other words, if you run it from a continuous integration system or redirect its output to a file—the results are displayed in human\-readable, machine\-parsable TAP format \fIhttp://testanything\.org/wiki/index\.php/TAP_specification#THE_TAP_FORMAT\fR\. You can force TAP output from a terminal by invoking Bats with the \fB\-\-tap\fR option\.
